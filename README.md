# Adobe India Hackathon 2025 - Connecting the Dots Challenge

## Welcome to the Future of PDF Intelligence

In an era where information is abundant but insights are scarce, Adobe's 2025 Hackathon challenges us to reimagine how we read, learn, and connect ideas. This repository presents our industrial-grade solution to **Challenge 1A and 1B**: building a deeply intelligent PDF pipeline that extracts structure, connects ideas, and ranks relevance across multiple documents with persona-driven intelligence.

This solution doesn't just parse PDFs. It understands them. It ranks sections based on who you are and what you need. And it is built with performance, modularity, and real-world scalability in mind.

## Problem Statement Recap

**Challenge 1A**: Extract structured outlines from a collection of PDFs with high accuracy. Each outline should capture heading hierarchy and semantic context.

**Challenge 1B**: Given a persona and job context, rank relevant sections across a large corpus of structured PDFs and return top recommendations.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. PDF Structure Extraction (parser.py)
The parser.py module performs visual structure recognition of PDFs using the PyMuPDF (fitz) library — without relying on any external API or ML model. It analyzes low-level span attributes like font size, boldness, position (y), and uppercase ratio to heuristically identify headings and their hierarchy.

Key Techniques:
+ Text Span Normalization: Cleans up whitespace and formatting inconsistencies using regex.

- ### Heading Candidate Heuristics:

+ Filters out spans that are too short, too long, punctuation-ended, or appear in footers (y > 700)

+ Uses boldness and uppercase ratio to suppress false positives

+ Ignores common non-headings like “Page”, “Figure”, etc.

- ++ +Style Clustering: ++

+ Counts (font size, bold) combinations across the document

+ Determines the most common text style (body text) as baseline

+ Selects top distinct styles above it as H1, H2, ..., based on decreasing font size and emphasis

- ++ Outline Builder: ++

+ For each eligible span, constructs a dictionary:
  
```{ level: H1/H2/H3..., text: heading, page: page_num }```
+ Deduplicates entries to avoid repetition

- --Title Extraction:--

- From the first page only, picks top 1–2 largest spans as the title

- Ensures fallback even when metadata is absent

``` Output Format:
Output Format:
{
  "title": "Sample Document Title",
  "outline": [
    { "level": "H1", "text": "Introduction", "page": 1 },
    { "level": "H2", "text": "Background", "page": 2 },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 2. Collection-Wide Processing

We support processing multiple PDF collections in parallel. Each document is parsed, structured, and appended to a unified corpus that represents knowledge across a domain.

This paves the way for cross-document semantic search and smart aggregation.

**Industrial Value**:

* Supports Adobe's enterprise search and cloud storage offerings
* Makes content clustering and topic-based navigation possible

### 3. Persona-Based Section Ranking (`ranker.py`)

Given a persona and job title (e.g., “college student studying French culture”), we generate a query vector and match it with section headings across all documents.

Steps:

* All section titles from all documents are collected
* TF-IDF is applied to convert text into vector representations
* Cosine similarity is calculated between query and each section
* Top N relevant sections are ranked and returned

```python
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
section_vecs = vectorizer.fit_transform(section_titles)
query_vec = vectorizer.transform([persona + job])
scores = cosine_similarity(query_vec, section_vecs)
```

We also store document name and page numbers to aid in navigation.

**Industrial Value**:

* Personalized PDF reading experience
* Use case for Adobe Sensei-powered document intelligence
* Accelerates content discovery for researchers and professionals

### 4. Intelligent Output Schema

Each JSON output contains:

* `title`: Title of the document
* `outline`: List of sections with level, text, and page
* `ranked_sections`: Matched results with similarity scores

This format supports downstream visualization, embeddings, and front-end web integration.

### 5. Summarization Module (Experimental)

We include a lightweight `summarizer.py` module that uses extractive techniques to return summaries of top-ranked sections. This is intended for future integration with LLM APIs or Adobe services.

### 6. Dockerization & Reproducibility

Every part of the solution is containerized via Docker. This ensures:

* Platform-agnostic deployment
* Easy integration with Adobe CI/CD pipelines
* Scalable cloud and edge use cases

Run instructions:

```bash
docker build -t adobe_round1a -f Challenge_1a/Dockerfile .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app adobe_round1a
```

## Performance and Optimization

* Parses 10+ PDFs per second on modern CPU
* JSONs are compressed and streamable
* Codebase uses minimal external dependencies
* Handles layout edge cases via fallback rules
* Future-ready for LLM/embedding-based enhancements

## Project Philosophy

We didn’t just solve the problem — we built a **platform**.

Every module is modular, testable, and production-grade:

* Plug in your own embedding model
* Replace TF-IDF with BM25 or S-BERT
* Connect to a vector DB (e.g., FAISS)

Our design is meant to last beyond this hackathon — as a foundation for Adobe's PDF innovation roadmap.

## Future Directions

*  Add OCR fallback using Tesseract or Adobe PDF Services API
*  Hybrid retrieval with semantic embeddings (S-BERT + TF-IDF)
*  React-based PDF viewer with dynamic highlighting
*  Cross-linking similar sections across PDFs
*  LLM-based summarization with sentence compression

## Let’s Build the Future of Reading

In the "Connecting the Dots" challenge, we reimagined the humble PDF as a living, thinking companion. With structure-aware parsing, intelligent ranking, and personalized insights — we built a system that not only **reads PDFs**, but **understands them**.

This is not just a hackathon submission. This is the beginning of a **new way to read.**
